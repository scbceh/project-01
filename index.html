        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I am happy that you are here! I am a graphic, UX, and web designer based in Orlando, Florida. I have always been in love with computers. When I was 18 years old, I had an interest in graphic design. The first two years, I wasn't too much attracted to it until I came to the United States in 2001. I continued my studies at college. At that moment, I fell in love with typography, colors, and layout. Once I graduated with my AS in Graphic Design, freelance projects began to appear in my life. I can say that 90% of them are all web design. In 2020 I decided to expand my design knowledge. UX Design complements perfectly with graphic and web design. I can say that I am a UX Designer! Feel free to browse my UX Design portfolio or contact me if you have an internship opportunity.</p>
